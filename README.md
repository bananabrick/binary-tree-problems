# binary-tree-problems
Solving some binary tree problems for fun. 
I'll be solving the problems in this link ==> http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/110/BinaryTrees.html

I'll solve them in python mostly using recursion. 

I'm considering a binary tree to be a root with 0, 1, or 2 branches where each branch itself is a binary tree.

Alright, let's get started.
